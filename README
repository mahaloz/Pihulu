TODO: Bassicly we need to finish the setter program

The blocker program takes in a program and dumps all the jmps, then removes all
the unconditional jmps. Then outputs to a jmps.txt file.

blocker.py ------> jmps.txt (full of addresses gdb ready)

The tracer program takes the jmps.txt and runs a break at each point in the target
file through gdb. The program also does math at each stop to determine the path 
diversity.
	
jmps.txt ----> tracer.py -----> gdb 

The setter program essentialy imports the tracer.py program into gdb to allow it to
call python methods for math. The setter also creates the stop hooks that invoke
the path_math() method.

setter.gdbinit<>---------<>gdb<>-------<-----tracer.py

In full the program works like this so far:

target --> blocker --> jmps.txt --> tracer <--\
|                                     ||      | 
|				      \/   setter
\----------------------------------> GDB <----/

yup.
